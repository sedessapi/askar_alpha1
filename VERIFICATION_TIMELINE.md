## Quick Answer to "What phase will there be online verification and offline verification?"

### **1. Online Verification (ACA-Py):**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code exists but NOT TESTED** (Phase 0 - current state)
  - Location: `lib/services/acapy_client.dart` and `lib/services/hybrid_verification_service.dart`
  - Implementation complete
  - Can verify credentials via REST API to Traction ACA-Py server
  - **Needs testing with real server to confirm it works**

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced version: Phase 3** (integrated into 3-tier system)
  - Will be part of `EnhancedVerificationService`
  - Same functionality, better integration
  - Automatic tier selection and fallback logic
  - **This is when ACA-Py verification gets tested and goes live**

### **2. Offline Verification:**

#### **A. Offline Structural (Format Validation):**

- ‚úÖ **ALREADY WORKING** (Phase 0 - current state)
  - Location: `lib/services/credential_verifier.dart`
  - Checks JSON format, required fields, data types
  - No cryptographic verification
  - Validated and tested

#### **B. Offline Crypto (Trust Bundle):**

- üéØ **Phase 3** (NEW - cryptographic verification)
  - Ed25519 signature verification
  - SHA-256 hash verification
  - Full cryptographic checking offline
  - **This is the NEW capability being added**
  - Works completely offline after trust bundle is synced

### **Summary:**

**Phase 3 is the critical milestone** because that's when:
- Offline crypto verification goes live (NEW capability)
- Online ACA-Py verification gets TESTED and integrated (existing code)
- All three tiers work together with automatic fallback
- You get the complete 3-tier verification system

**Before Phase 3**: You have offline structural (tested)  
**After Phase 3**: You have offline crypto (Trust Bundle) + online crypto (ACA-Py tested) + offline structural

The **big unlock** is **offline cryptographic verification** in **Phase 3**! üéâ  
**Plus**: Online ACA-Py verification gets properly tested and integrated!

## Verification Type Details

### 1. Offline Structural Verification

**Available**: Now (pre-Phase 1)

**How it works**:
```dart
// Checks:
- JSON is valid and parsable
- Required fields present (credentialSubject, issuer, etc.)
- Data types correct (strings, objects, arrays)
- Schema reference exists
- Credential definition reference exists

// Does NOT check:
- Digital signatures
- Cryptographic integrity
- Issuer authenticity
- Tampering detection
```

**Use Case**: Quick format validation, fallback when crypto unavailable

**Tier**: 3 (Lowest confidence)

---

### 2. Online Crypto Verification (ACA-Py)

**Available**: Now (basic), Phase 3 (enhanced)

**How it works**:
```dart
// Via REST API to Traction ACA-Py server:
- Sends credential to /credential/verify endpoint
- ACA-Py performs full cryptographic verification:
  * Signature verification
  * Issuer DID resolution
  * Revocation status check (if applicable)
  * Schema validation
  * Credential definition validation
- Returns verified: true/false

// Requirements:
- Network connection
- ACA-Py server reachable
- Server has necessary schemas/credDefs
```

**Use Case**: Real-time verification with revocation checks

**Tier**: 2 (Good confidence)

---

### 3. Offline Crypto Verification (Trust Bundle)

**Available**: Phase 3 (NEW!)

**How it works**:
```dart
// Using trust_bundle_core package:
- Load trust bundle (pre-synced schemas + credDefs)
- Extract credential signature
- Resolve issuer's public key via did:key
- Verify Ed25519 signature
- Compute SHA-256 hash of credential
- Compare against manifest hash
- Validate schema matches
- Validate credDef matches

// Requirements:
- Trust bundle synced (can be done offline after initial sync)
- Issuer in trusted keys list
- Schema and credDef in local database

// Works completely offline after sync
```

**Use Case**: High-confidence verification without network

**Tier**: 1 (Best confidence)

## Testing Strategy Per Phase

### Phase 1 Testing:
```bash
cd trust_bundle_core
flutter test
# Verify all crypto tests pass
```

### Phase 2 Testing:
```bash
# Manual testing:
1. Switch between modes
2. Restart app - verify mode persists
3. Check existing features still work
```

### Phase 3 Testing: ‚≠ê CRITICAL
```bash
# Test each tier independently:
1. Offline crypto (trust bundle):
   - Sync trust bundle
   - Disable network
   - Verify credential
   - Should show green "BEST" badge

2. Online crypto (ACA-Py):
   - Disable trust bundle
   - Enable network
   - Verify credential
   - Should show blue "GOOD" badge

3. Structural fallback:
   - Disable trust bundle
   - Disable network
   - Verify credential
   - Should show orange "LIMITED" badge

# Test automatic fallback:
4. Start with all enabled
   - Should try trust bundle first
   - Fall back to ACA-Py if trust bundle fails
   - Fall back to structural if both fail
```

### Phase 4 Testing:
```bash
# Test verifier mode:
1. Switch to verifier mode
2. Sync trust bundle
3. Generate test QR code (from holder mode)
4. Scan with verifier mode
5. Verify shows in audit log
```

### Phase 5 Testing:
```bash
# Full regression testing:
1. Test all modes (holder/verifier/hybrid)
2. Test all verification tiers
3. Test offline scenarios
4. Test online scenarios
5. Performance benchmarks
6. UI/UX review
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Phase 3 Risks (Critical Phase):
**Risk**: Trust bundle integration breaks existing verification
**Mitigation**: Keep structural verification as guaranteed fallback

**Risk**: Crypto verification too slow
**Mitigation**: Performance benchmarks, async processing, caching

**Risk**: Trust bundle database corruption
**Mitigation**: Validation on sync, atomic transactions, backup/restore

### Phase 4 Risks:
**Risk**: QR scanning doesn't work on all devices
**Mitigation**: Manual verification as alternative, platform-specific testing

### Phase 5 Risks:
**Risk**: Integration bugs discovered late
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing phase, beta testing program
