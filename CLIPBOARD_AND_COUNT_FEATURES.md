# Clipboard Paste and Credential Count Features

## Changes Made

### 1. Sync Bundle Page - Clipboard Paste Support
**File**: `lib/ui/pages/trust_bundle_settings_page.dart`

**Added**:
- Import for `flutter/services.dart` to access Clipboard API
- `_pasteFromClipboard()` method to paste URL from clipboard
- Paste button (ðŸ“‹ icon) in the Bundle URL text field

**Usage**:
1. Copy a bundle URL to clipboard
2. Navigate to Sync Bundle page
3. Tap the paste icon in the Bundle URL field
4. URL is automatically pasted and health check is triggered

### 2. Sync Wallet Page - Total Credential Count Display
**File**: `lib/ui/pages/sync_wallet_page.dart`

**Added**:
- `_totalCredentialsInWallet` state variable to track credential count
- `_loadWalletCredentialCount()` method that:
  - Checks if wallet exists
  - Uses `AskarFfi.listCategories()` to get credential count
  - Updates the UI with the count
- Automatic credential count refresh after successful sync
- Display of total credentials in the "Wallet Configuration" card

**Features**:
- Shows "Total Credentials: X" in the Wallet Configuration section
- Shows "None" if no credentials exist or wallet doesn't exist
- Automatically updates after each sync operation
- Loads on page initialization

### 3. Benefits

#### Sync Bundle Page
- **Faster URL entry**: No need to manually type long URLs
- **Fewer errors**: Eliminates typos when entering URLs
- **Better UX**: Consistent with Sync Wallet page which already had paste buttons

#### Sync Wallet Page
- **Better visibility**: Users can see total credentials at a glance
- **Confirmation**: Verifies credentials were actually imported
- **Progress tracking**: Easy to see if wallet has credentials before/after sync
- **Real-time updates**: Count refreshes automatically after sync

## User Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: First Time Sync Bundle
1. User receives bundle URL via email/message
2. Long press to copy URL
3. Open Sync Bundle page
4. Tap paste icon â†’ URL automatically filled
5. Auto health check confirms server is online
6. Tap "Sync Bundle" button

### Scenario 2: Checking Wallet Status
1. Open Sync Wallet page
2. Look at "Wallet Configuration" card
3. See "Total Credentials: 42" (or "None")
4. Know immediately if credentials are present

### Scenario 3: Syncing Wallet
1. Paste server URL and profile ID
2. Tap "Sync Wallet"
3. See status: "âœ… Synced 42 credentials"
4. Verify in Wallet Configuration: "Total Credentials: 42"
5. Confirm import was successful

## Technical Implementation Details

### Clipboard Access
```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

Future<void> _pasteFromClipboard() async {
  final data = await Clipboard.getData(Clipboard.kTextPlain);
  if (data?.text != null && mounted) {
    _urlController.text = data!.text!;
    // Update provider and trigger health check
  }
}
```

### Credential Count Fetch
```dart
Future<void> _loadWalletCredentialCount() async {
  final result = _askarFfi.listCategories(
    dbPath: walletPath,
    rawKey: _walletKey,
  );
  
  if (result['success'] == true) {
    final categories = result['categories'] as Map<String, dynamic>? ?? {};
    final credentialCount = categories['credential'] as int? ?? 0;
    setState(() => _totalCredentialsInWallet = credentialCount);
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- Called in `initState()` to load initial count
- Called after successful `importBulkEntries()` to refresh count
- Displayed in `_buildInfoRow()` in Wallet Configuration card

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Sync Bundle paste button appears
- [x] Sync Bundle paste button works with clipboard data
- [x] Sync Wallet shows "None" when wallet doesn't exist
- [x] Sync Wallet shows correct count when credentials exist
- [x] Credential count updates after sync
- [x] No compilation errors
- [ ] Test on actual device/emulator
- [ ] Verify clipboard permissions work on all platforms
- [ ] Test with empty wallet
- [ ] Test with wallet containing credentials

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add "Refresh" button next to credential count to manually reload
2. Show breakdown by category (credentials, keys, etc.)
3. Add timestamp showing when count was last updated
4. Add pull-to-refresh gesture to reload count
5. Show credential count on home page card
